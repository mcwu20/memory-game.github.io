## About

A simple game to flip and match cards. There is a timer and move counter to test the user's memory and speed.

Using the files from Udacity github repo as starting base, I added javaScript, CSS, and HTML to create an interactive game. 

## Instructions

* Click on a card to start game
* Click on the pause button to pause your game
* Click on the refresh button to start a new game
* Match all cards to win
* Get higher ratings with less moves!
